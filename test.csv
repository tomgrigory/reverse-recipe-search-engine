0,Miso-Butter Roast Chicken With Acorn Squash Panzanella,"['1 (3½–4-lb.) whole chicken', '2¾ tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more', '2 small acorn squash (about 3 lb. total)', '2 Tbsp. finely chopped sage', '1 Tbsp. finely chopped rosemary', '6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, plus 3 Tbsp. room temperature', '¼ tsp. ground allspice', 'Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '⅓ loaf good-quality sturdy white bread, torn into 1"" pieces (about 2½ cups)', '2 medium apples (such as Gala or Pink Lady; about 14 oz. total), cored, cut into 1"" pieces', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '½ small red onion, thinly sliced', '3 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar', '1 Tbsp. white miso', '¼ cup all-purpose flour', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature', '¼ cup dry white wine', '2 cups unsalted chicken broth', '2 tsp. white miso', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper']","Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.
Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into ½""-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.
Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.
Add bread, apples, oil, and ¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.
Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.
Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.
Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.
Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.
Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about ¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.

1,Crispy Salt and Pepper Potatoes,"['2 large egg whites', '1 pound new potatoes (about 1 inch in diameter)', '2 teaspoons kosher salt', '¾ teaspoon finely ground black pepper', '1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary', '1 teaspoon finely chopped thyme', '1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley']","Preheat oven to 400°F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites until foamy (there shouldn’t be any liquid whites in the bowl). Add the potatoes and toss until they’re well coated with the egg whites, then transfer to a strainer or colander and let the excess whites drain. Season the potatoes with the salt, pepper, and herbs.

2,Thanksgiving Mac and Cheese,"['1 cup evaporated milk', '1 cup whole milk', '1 tsp. garlic powder', '1 tsp. onion powder', '1 tsp. smoked paprika', '½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper', '1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more', '2 lb. extra-sharp cheddar, coarsely grated', '4 oz. full-fat cream cheese', '1 lb. elbow macaroni']","Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400°. Bring evaporated milk and whole milk to a bare simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, pepper, and 1 tsp. salt. Working in batches, whisk in three fourths of the cheddar, then all of the cream cheese.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil (it should have a little less salt than seawater). Cook macaroni, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 4 minutes. Drain in a colander.
Add macaroni to cheese sauce in pan and mix until well coated. Evenly spread out half of macaroni mixture in a 13x9"" baking dish. Sprinkle half of remaining cheddar evenly over.

3,Italian Sausage and Bread Stuffing,"['1 (¾- to 1-pound) round Italian loaf, cut into 1-inch cubes (8 cups)', '2 tablespoons olive oil, divided', '2 pounds sweet Italian sausage, casings removed, divided', '1 stick unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '3 medium onions, chopped', '4 large celery ribs, chopped', '5 garlic cloves, minced', '4 large eggs, lightly beaten', '¾ cup heavy cream, divided', '½ cup turkey giblet stock or reduced-sodium chicken broth', '1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (2 ounces)', '½ cup coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley', '4-qt shallow ceramic or glass baking dish']","Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Generously butter baking dish.
Put bread in 2 shallow baking pans and bake, switching position of pans halfway through baking, until just dried out, about 10 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook half of sausage, stirring and breaking it into small pieces, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a large bowl. Brown remaining sausage in remaining tablespoon oil, transferring to bowl.
Pour off fat from skillet and wipe clean. Heat butter over medium heat until foam subsides, then cook onions, celery, garlic, and ½ teaspoon each of salt and pepper, stirring occasionally, until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Add vegetables and bread to sausage.
Whisk together eggs, ½ cup cream, turkey stock, cheese, and parsley, then stir into stuffing and cool completely, about 30 minutes. Reserve 5 cups stuffing to stuff turkey and spoon remainder into baking dish, then drizzle with remaining ¼ cup cream. Cover stuffing and chill.
About 1 hour before stuffed turkey is finished roasting, bring dish of stuffing to room temperature. When turkey is done, increase oven temperature to 425°F and bake stuffing, covered tightly with foil, until hot throughout, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake until top is golden and crisp, about 15 minutes more.
Cooks' Note: Bread can be toasted 3 days ahead and kept (once cool) in a sealed bag at room temperature. Stuffing can be prepared (but not baked) 4 hours before roasting turkey. If baking stuffing at the same time as potatoes, put stuffing in upper third of oven and potatoes in bottom third (allow extra time).",italian-sausage-and-bread-stuffing-240559,"['1 (¾- to 1-pound) round Italian loaf, cut into 1-inch cubes (8 cups)', '2 tablespoons olive oil, divided', '2 pounds sweet Italian sausage, casings removed, divided', '1 stick unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '3 medium onions, chopped', '4 large celery ribs, chopped', '5 garlic cloves, minced', '4 large eggs, lightly beaten', '¾ cup heavy cream, divided', '½ cup turkey giblet stock or reduced-sodium chicken broth', '1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (2 ounces)', '½ cup coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley', '4-qt shallow ceramic or glass baking dish']"
